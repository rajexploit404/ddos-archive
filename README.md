##  Description

This archive is a curated collection of documented Layer4 (transport layer) DDoS techniques, including both **historical methods** and **leaked scripts** that have surfaced publicly over time.  
This project is intended to help network engineers, researchers, and blue-team defenders **understand, analyze, and mitigate** these techniques — **not to deploy them**.
